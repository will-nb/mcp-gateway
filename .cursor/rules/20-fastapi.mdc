# FastAPI rules

- Organize endpoints under `app/api/v1/endpoints/*` and register in `app/api/v1/api.py`.
- Response models must be pydantic classes in `app/schemas/*`.
- Use dependency injection for services in routers; avoid direct globals.
- Raise `HTTPException` with clear messages; map internal exceptions in middleware.
- Include minimal example payloads in docstrings when useful.
