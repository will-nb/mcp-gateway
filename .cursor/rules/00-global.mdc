# Global rules (mcp-gateway)

- This repository is internal-only. Do not add any public auth layers by default.
- Prefer explicit, readable code over clever one-liners.
- All external calls must be wrapped with timeouts and error handling.
- Document long-running or potentially flaky operations inline (short docstrings).
- Keep configuration in `app/core/config.py`; do not hardcode secrets.
